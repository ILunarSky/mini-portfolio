under your code folder (or anywhere you want really) you are going to make a new folder, you can use a file explorer, vscode, or the mkdir command, such as 

```
mkdir first-portfolio
```

after this we are going to use either vscode or your file explorer to find the folder that you made for your portfolio exercise, and we are going to copy them over from your SDA-Ghazal files over to your new portfolio folder. (If there's a read me don't copy it over')

Once you have this completed open your personal github, 

click on your profile image in the top right

click on repositories

click create/new repository, it could say either based on if you already have repositories or not.

give it a name

click create repository

in your terminal cd into the folder that you made for your portfolio

copy the code inside of the github repository under "...or create a new repository on the command line"

paste it into your terminal where you have your files for your portfolio.

log into, or create a netlify account. (I recommend signing in with github)

After signing in click import from git

Click on github

Click on authorize if it requests authorization

I prefer to choose to give netlify access to all repositories, you could choose to only do select ones

It will then ask you to sign in again to authorize. 

After this go back to netlify and click on your project

give it a name and click deploy!

Hopefully you have a deployed web page!
